        <h3>A south american classic</h3>
        <p>An Empanada is a baked or fried pastry from southern america, that makes for a great and filling main dish.
            It has many variations and can be filled with basically any ingredients you like.
            It is usually served accompanying a often selfmade dip, which I also have a recipe for. <strong>So check it out <a href="./empanadadip.html">here</a>! </strong> </p>
        <p>In this recipe I will only cover one way to make your filling, but you can try something entirely different later.</p>

        <h3>The ingredients you'll need</h3>
        <strong>for the dough:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 cup cold butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup ice cold water</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>for the filling:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup minced garlic</li>
            <li>500 grams minced meat (i tried both beef and pork, but others should work aswell)</li>
            <li>3 tbsp soya sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup diced carrot</li>
            <li>1 cup diced potato</li>
            <li>1/2 cup bell pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup raisins (might seem weird but they're <em>great</em>)</li>
            <li>An appropriate amount of oil for your pan</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Making the dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>mix the <strong>flour with the salt, sugar and baking powder</strong> in a bowl</li>
            <li>add the <strong>butter</strong> and mix till mixed</li>
            <li>add the <strong>water</strong> and properly mix</li>
            <li>if the dough is brittle, slowly incorporate more water till it's not</li>
            <li>now roll the dough into a ball and wrap it with cling film</li>
            <li>let it chill in the fridge for <strong>30 minutes</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Making the filling</h3>
        <img src="../images/filling.png" alt="filling for the empanadas" height="400" width="300">
        <ol>
            <li>saute the onion in your pan</li>
            <li>add the garlic</li>
            <li>add the <strong>minced meat</strong> and season with <strong>salt and pepper</strong></li>
            <li>let it cook til it's somewhat done</li>
            <li>add the <strong>remaining ingredients</strong> and cook til everything's done</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Making the Empanadas</h3>
        <img src="../images/filledempanadas.png" alt="raw empanadas with folded edges and a filling" height="300" width="400">
        <ol>
            <li>cover a surface in flour</li>
            <li>roll out the dough in the surface</li>
            <li>cut circles out of the dough using f.e. a cup (the circles should be about palm sized)</li>
            <li>put about <strong>a tablespoon</strong> of filling on each circle</li>
            <li>fold the circles into a half moon shape and seal the edges</li>
            <li><strong>now comes a hard part:</strong> you have to fold over the edges into lots of small triangles (it should look somewhat like the picture above)</li>
        </ol>
            <p>Now you can either bake them in an oven for <strong>15 minutes</strong> or (as <em>I</em> prefer to do) you can fry them in a pan with a somewhat large amount of oil (the empanadas should be able to be half submerged in the oil)</p>
            <p><strong>Now your empanadas should be ready to serve!</strong> But if you're looking for a dessert to serve after, you can take a look at my </p>
